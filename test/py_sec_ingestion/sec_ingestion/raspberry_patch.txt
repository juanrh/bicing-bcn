Download the script https://github.com/dirttech/SmartMeter/blob/master/wifi_drop.sh, copy it somewhere and execute 'sudo nohup ./wifi_drop.sh', this way the wifi connection of the raspberry is recovered automatically. A proper deployment would add this script to rc.local or similar. Recipe taken from http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/8267/wifi-connection-lost-after-about-12-hours
